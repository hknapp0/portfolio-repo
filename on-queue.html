<!--Intro-->
<sec>
        <h3 class="center">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="centers">
     Waiting in line is sometimes inevitable and can be time consuming. Being late for an event can cause stress
    and anxiety. We observed that the market for this type of application is extremely undersaturated, even non-existent. Therefore, we believe that more users would benefit from a live tracking line wait time app.
        </p>
        <h3 class=" center"> The Solution</h3>
        <p class="centers">
            Create a tool that allows users to live track line wait times. This will allow users to better delegate
            their time before an event. Also, adding a feature that allows users to skip the line all together to combat the
            fear of
            missing out.</p>
  </div>
  <!--Research-->
<h3 class=" center"> The Research</h3>
    <p class="centers">
We started by conducting interviews, with the conclusions from our interviews we were able to group our findings in an
affinity diagram and empathy map. 
<img src="https://hknapp0.github.io/hk-repo/iq-1.png" class="middle" />
</p>
<p class="centers">After discovering more about our users, we created a proto-persona: Drew Ryan. Drew is
an avid night-lifer living in Philly that enjoys going out with her friends, but hates waiting in long lines and potentially
missing out on a part of the event. During interviews, we discovered that live tracking how long the line is for large
events would allow users to delegate their time better to ensure a punctual arrival. From this persona we were able to create a user flow to inspire our earliest
sketches of On Queue.</p>

<!--Design-->
<p class="centers">
            After we conducted extensive research, really putting ourselves in our users shoes and understanding their needs, we
           were ready to take our design to the next level! To get the best idea of the most necessary features we created a feature prioritization map and new user flow.</p>

        <!--lofi wireframes-->
           <p class="centers">With this information we had a clear idea of where we wanted to take On Queue. It was important to us that there were
        benefits to using On Queue to entice users to use the app more, making line wait times more accurate. From there we drew
        our first sketches and turned them into low fidelity wireframes.</p>

<!--Final Wireframes-->
<h3 class=" center"> High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p class="centers">Upon gaining
            feedback from our low fidelity wireframes we designed our final wireframes, to create the final clickable prototype for On
            Queue. On Queue was designed to be used like a social media app, relying on real people’s posts, reviews, and photos.</p>
